And let's check the huge one:
STATS: S  99%, I   1%, V   0%, n = 512
STATS: S  95%, I   5%, V   0%, n = 512
STATS: S  84%, I  16%, V   0%, n = 512


Part Four: Propagate N Times
0 - STATS: S  37%, I  63%, V   0%, n =   8
1 - STATS: S   0%, I 100%, V   0%, n =   8

7	0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0 	I (2)
===============
STATS: S   0%, I 100%, V   0%, n =   8

And back to huge:
0 - STATS: S  51%, I  49%, V   0%, n = 512
1 - STATS: S  19%, I  81%, V   0%, n = 512
2 - STATS: S   5%, I  95%, V   0%, n = 512
3 - STATS: S   0%, I 100%, V   0%, n = 512
4 - STATS: S   0%, I 100%, V   0%, n = 512
5 - STATS: S   0%, I 100%, V   0%, n = 512
6 - STATS: S   0%, I 100%, V   0%, n = 512
7 - STATS: S   0%, I 100%, V   0%, n = 512
8 - STATS: S   0%, I 100%, V   0%, n = 512
9 - STATS: S   0%, I 100%, V   0%, n = 512
And now we propagate with probability
0 - STATS: S  93%, I   7%, V   0%, n =  64
1 - STATS: S  85%, I  15%, V   0%, n =  64
2 - STATS: S  76%, I  24%, V   0%, n =  64
3 - STATS: S  53%, I  47%, V   0%, n =  64
4 - STATS: S  25%, I  75%, V   0%, n =  64
5 - STATS: S   6%, I  94%, V   0%, n =  64
6 - STATS: S   3%, I  97%, V   0%, n =  64
7 - STATS: S   1%, I  99%, V   0%, n =  64
8 - STATS: S   0%, I 100%, V   0%, n =  64
9 - STATS: S   0%, I 100%, V   0%, n =  64
Trying on medium:
0 - STATS: S  93%, I   7%, V   0%, n =  16
1 - STATS: S  93%, I   7%, V   0%, n =  16
2 - STATS: S  93%, I   7%, V   0%, n =  16
3 - STATS: S  93%, I   7%, V   0%, n =  16

0 - STATS: S  93%, I   7%, V   0%, n =  16

5 - STATS: S  75%, I  25%, V   0%, n =  16
6 - STATS: S  68%, I  32%, V   0%, n =  16
7 - STATS: S  56%, I  44%, V   0%, n =  16
